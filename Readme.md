# Collection of fundemental numerical problems

This repository contains a collection of implementations to common numerical problems. Note that the code is not yet optimized ot very sophisticated. It is rather a direct implementation of the procedures to control calculations by hand and to have a starting point for further work-

## Content

* Eigenvalues: At the time only with power iteration, but already extended to compute all available eigenvalues; Note that A has to be a symmetric matrix
* interpolation: Global interpolation with Aitken and Newton; cubical splines on schedule
* Ordinary Differential Equations: Not yet started
* Quadrature: Quadrature with simpson and trapecoidal sum. Romberg quadrature scheduled
* Systems of linear equations: At the time only iterative solvers; LR decomposition and Gauss scheduled
